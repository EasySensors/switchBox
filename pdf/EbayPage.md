### The Switch Box (IS6DB2032) is a low cost wireless Arduino IDE compatible (the Atmel ATMega328P) microcontroller with HopeRF RFM69 868\915 or NRF24L01+ 2.4 GHz radio on-board. Best sutable for Home Automation, IOT. Could be used as switch board for radio controlling any DIY project. 

## Features
- Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MHz)
- RFM69-CW (low power consumption version) 868\915 MHz Radio transceiver
- Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming you need to have USB TTL Serial â€“ FTDI adaptor
- MySensors compatible. You can use superb set of scripts and libraries from [mysensors.org](http://www.mysensors.org) project  and convert the nodes into reliable network of little home sensors, relays and actuators.
- Onboard tuned pcb antenna
- Each button have LED for message delivery confirmation
- Battery connector: 2 x CR2032
- Reverse polarity protection
- High efficiency power coverter 
- Long run soft touch buttons

## Overview
If you are familiar with Arduino boards, the Switch Box is Arduino pro Mini with onboard HopeRF RFM69-CW radio with one or two buttons and confirmation LED's. To save some board dimensions the Switch Box does not have onboard USB-Serial converter. You need to buy FTDI Adapter for programming. HopeRF RFM69-CW provide extremely good range. Hundreds of meters in open areas. Some IOT ideas based on the Switch Box and similar controllers plus complete specs you may find here [my GitHub page](https://github.com/EasySensors/switchBox)

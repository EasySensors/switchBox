### The Switch Box (IS6DB2032) is a low cost wireless Arduino IDE compatible (the Atmel ATMega328P) microcontroller with HopeRF RFM69 868\915 or NRF24L01+ 2.4 GHz radio on-board. Best sutable for Home Automation, IOT. Could be used as switch board for radio controlling any DIY project. 

## Features
- Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MG Hz)
- RFM69-CW (low power consumption version) 868\915 MHz Radio transceiver
- Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip makes communication with the Switch Box very secured. ATSHA204A implements secured handshake and if handshake fails the Switch Box will not executing any command sent to it
- Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming you need to have USB TTL Serial â€“ FTDI adaptor
- MySensors compatible. You can use superb set of scripts and libraries from [mysensors.org](http://www.mysensors.org) project  and convert the nodes into reliable network of little home sensors, relays and actuators.
- Battery connector: 2 x CR2032
- Reverse polarity protection

Comes with Arduino example sketch.

## Overview
If you are familiar with Arduino boards, the Switch Box is Arduino pro Mini with onboard HopeRF RFM69-CW 433 MHz radio, external EPROM flash and crypto authentication chip. To save some board dimensions the Switch Box does not have onboard USB-Serial converter. You need to buy FTDI Adapter for programming. HopeRF RFM69-CW provide extremely good range. Hundreds of meters in open areas. External Flash chip allows burning Arduino sketch wirelessly. Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip secures communication with other controllers.

### Who Needs It and Why?
It does simple thing – Send on\off signals to any relay, actuator or trigger an event.
Radio used here is RFM95 LORA 433/868/915 MHz or  RFM69-HCW|CW 433/868/915 MHz 
We created the SwitchBox as part of our effort to make nice looking switch, which can be stuck to the wall anywhere with adhesive or screws.  
Long lasting as of couple of years while in daily use.
Secured handshake can be used, backed by ATSHA204A Crypto Authentication chip. 	
### The SwitchBox designed for makers and hobbyists and is easy to program with Arduino IDE.

### Features & Specifications
-	Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MG Hz)
-	Radio transceivers: RFM95 LORA 433/868/915 MHz or  RFM69-CW 433/868/915 MHz (low power consumption version) 
-	Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A Crypto Authentication chip makes communication with the Switch Box very secured. ATSHA204A implements secured handshake and if handshake fails the Switch Box will not executing any command sent to it
-	Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming you need to have USB TTL Serial – FTDI adaptor
-	Compatible with all RFM 69 \ 95 compatible open source libraries available
-	Onboard tuned PCB  antenna
-	Each button have LED for message delivery confirmation
-	Battery connector: 2 x CR2032
-	Reverse polarity protection
-	High efficient power converter 
-	Long run soft touch buttons
